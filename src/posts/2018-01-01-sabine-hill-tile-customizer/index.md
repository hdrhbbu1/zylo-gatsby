This is a little react app that allows you to manipulate SVG patterns and see them in a grid. Created for <a href="https://sabinehill.com/" target="_blank">Sabine Hill</a>, it allows customers to preview their choices of tile color and arrangement.

This project was all about manipulating SVG data in react.

Since tracing the 30-plus SVG patterns and then editing them by hand in order to make them play nicely with React didn't seem like something I wanted to do, in true developer fashion, I also created a nice little node command-line tool that does the work for me ðŸ‘Œ.

I've included to tile customizer itself here, so have a play!
